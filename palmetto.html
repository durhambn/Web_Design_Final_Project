<h3>Palmetto Fellows Scholarship</h3>
<p>This is a merit-based program established in 1988. Palmetto Fellows may receive up to $6,700 their freshman year and up to $7,500 for their sophomore, junior and senior years. The scholarship must be applied directly toward the cost of attendance, less any other gift aid received. Assuming continued eligibility, Palmetto Fellows may recieve Scholarship funding for a maximum of eight full-time terms of study toward their first bachelor's degree at an eligible four year institution in South Carolina.</p>
<p>The Palmetto Fellows Scholarship Enhancement was established in 2007 to increase the number of students who major in mathematics and science in South Carolina.  For Enhancement eligibility, Palmetto Fellows must declare a major in an approved math or science program.  Beginning with the Fall 2007 freshman class and thereafter, Palmetto Fellows must also successfully complete at least fourteen credit hours of instruction in mathematics or life and physical science or a combination of both by the end of the first academic year.  Eligible students may receive up to $10,000 (combined funds from the Palmetto Fellows Scholarship and the Scholarship Enhancement) per year beginning with their second/sophomore year of college enrollment.  Students may receive Enhancement funding for a maximum of six full-time terms of study toward their first bachelor's degree at an eligible four-year institution in South Carolina. </p>
